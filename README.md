# Pytest API Automation Framework

This project is a simple yet comprehensive API automation testing framework built with **Python**, **Pytest**, and **Requests**. It features reusable fixtures, parameterized tests, custom markers, and generates HTML reports using `pytest-html`.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pytest** – For writing and organizing tests.
- **Requests** – For making HTTP calls to RESTful APIs.
- **pytest-html** – For generating clean, readable HTML test reports.

---

## Features

- **Automated API Testing** – Validates REST APIs for correctness.
- **Reusable Fixtures** – Simplifies setup and teardown across tests.
- **Parameterized Tests** – Run the same test with multiple sets of data.
- **Custom Markers** – Easily run specific groups of tests.
- **HTML Reporting** – Visual test result reports generated after each run.
